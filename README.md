# Python-API-Challenge

Python script, APIs, and JSON traversals to prove the answer to a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

WeatherPy

Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities all over the world. Utilize a Python library, and the OpenWeatherMap API website. 

Thus, create a Python script to show each of the following:

•	Scatter plots to showcase the relationships
	Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
	Humidity (%) vs Latitude
	Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
	Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

•	Linear regression on each relationship
	Northern Hemisphere – Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
	Southern Hemisphere – Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
	Northern Hemisphere – Humidity (%) vs Latitude
	Southern Hemisphere – Humidity (%) vs Latitude
	Northern Hemisphere – Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
	Southern Hemisphere – Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
	Northern Hemisphere – Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
	Southern Hemisphere – Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
VacationPy
Jupter-gmaps and the Google Places API to visualize the weather of 500+ cities all over the world. Utilize a Python library, and the OpenWeatherMap API website. 

Thus, create a script to show each of the following:
•	Heat map that displays the humidity for every city in WeatherPy
•	Create a Dataframe that indicate
o	A max temperature lower than 265 degrees
o	Wind speed less than 10 mph
o	Zero cloudiness
•	Utilize Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of the coordinates
•	Plot the hotels on top of your humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country
